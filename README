All of the code to run is written in python.
Run feature_extractor.py with the feature extraction
function defined to generate features from the sample
images. Use "cat" to put files together into training
and testing data, and use the different test files -
pca.py, kmeans.py, qda.py, and train_test.py - to see
how the algorithm performs. fft_extractor.py does the actual
fourier analysis.
